# Learn Mirascope [Link to this heading](https://mirascope.com/docs/mirascope/learn\#learn-mirascope)

This section is designed to help you master Mirascope, a toolkit for building AI-powered applications with Large Language Models (LLMs).

Our documentation is tailored for developers who have at least some experience with Python and LLMs. Whether you're coming from other development tool libraries or have worked directly with provider SDKs and APIs, Mirascope offers a familiar but enhanced experience.

If you haven't already, we recommend checking out [Getting Started](https://mirascope.com/docs/mirascope/guides/getting-started/quickstart) and [Why Use Mirascope](https://mirascope.com/docs/mirascope/getting-started/why).

## Key Features and Benefits [Link to this heading](https://mirascope.com/docs/mirascope/learn\#key-features-and-benefits)

### Pythonic By Design

Our design approach is to remain Pythonic so you can build your way

### Editor Support & Type Hints

Rich autocomplete, inline documentation, and type hints to catch errors before runtime

### Provider-Agnostic & Provider-Specific

Seamlessly engineer prompts agnostic or specific to various LLM providers

### Comprehensive Tooling

Complete suite of tools for every aspect of working with LLM provider APIs

## Core Components [Link to this heading](https://mirascope.com/docs/mirascope/learn\#core-components)

Mirascope is built around these core components, each designed to handle specific aspects of working with LLM provider APIs.

We encourage you to dive into each component's documentation to gain a deeper understanding of Mirascope's capabilities. Start with the topics that align most closely with your immediate needs, but don't hesitate to explore all areas – you might discover new ways to enhance your LLM applications!
