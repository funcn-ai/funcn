<actions parallel="true">
1. git log --follow -- $ARGUMENTS && git blame $ARGUMENTS
2. rg -l "$ARGUMENTS" → find all usages
3. rg -B2 -A2 "$ARGUMENTS" → understand contexts
4. Ask as if interviewing creator: Why created? Alternatives? Do differently? Most important? Breaks often? Bottlenecks?
5. Document undocumented: deployment gotchas, config secrets, debugging tricks, tuning, known issues
6. Create `.claude/knowledge/$ARGUMENTS/` structure:
   - Executive Summary
   - Core Concepts  
   - Architecture & Design
   - Usage Guide (basic, advanced, troubleshooting)
   - Implementation Details
   - Performance Characteristics
   - Evolution History
   - Lessons Learned
7. Generate one-page quick reference
8. Create FAQ from issues and comments
</actions>

Create time capsule for future developers. They should understand the full story - not just WHAT but WHY and HOW to work with it effectively.

Take a deep breath in, count 1... 2... 3... and breathe out. You are now centered. Don't hold back. Give it your all.
