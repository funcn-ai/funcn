Daily standup replacement - comprehensive development status and prioritization
Need clear picture of work state and optimal task order
</context>

<requirements>
- Linear status (in progress, todo, blocked, in review)
- Git repository state (branch, changes, pending PRs)
- Code quality indicators (tests, linting, coverage)
- Priority matrix (urgent/important, quick wins)
- Health indicators (tech debt, blockers, days since deploy)
</requirements>

<actions parallel="true">
1. mcp_linear.list_my_issues() â†’ categorize by status
2. git status && git diff --stat && git log --oneline -10
3. gh pr list --author @me
4. pytest -x && ruff check --select E,F
5. Generate priority matrix: ðŸ”´ Urgent (blocked PRs, critical bugs) ðŸŸ¡ Important (features, reviews) ðŸŸ¢ Quick wins
6. Create focused action items with specific Linear issue numbers
7. Identify blockers, risks, coordination needs
8. Generate end-of-day checklist
</actions>
