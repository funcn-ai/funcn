# Development Workflow

This document outlines the standard workflow for making code changes in the Funcn project, ensuring proper issue tracking, branch management, and safe development practices.

## Workflow Overview

**NEVER make changes directly on the main branch.** Always follow this workflow:

1. Create a Linear project (for complex features) or standalone issue
2. Create and checkout the topic branch
3. Make changes in the feature branch
4. Create a pull request
5. Merge after review

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Create Linear Project and Issues

Before starting any work, create a project in Linear (or use an existing one) and organize your work with focused issues:

```python
# Check for existing project or create new one
projects = mcp_linear.list_projects(teamId="TEAM_ID", includeArchived=False)
project = next((p for p in projects if "PDF" in p.name and not p.completedAt), None)

if not project:
    project = mcp_linear.create_project(
        name="PDF Parsing Tool Implementation",
        description="Implement tools for PDF parsing and text extraction",
        teamId="TEAM_ID"
    )

# Create focused issues within the project
issues = [
    mcp_linear.create_issue(
        title="Create PDF parser tool structure",
        description="Set up component.json, tool.py, and basic structure",
        projectId=project.id,
        teamId="TEAM_ID"
    ),
    mcp_linear.create_issue(
        title="Implement PDF text extraction",
        description="Add core functionality to extract text from PDFs",
        projectId=project.id,
        teamId="TEAM_ID"
    ),
    mcp_linear.create_issue(
        title="Add error handling and validation",
        description="Handle corrupted PDFs, encrypted files, etc.",
        projectId=project.id,
        teamId="TEAM_ID"
    ),
    mcp_linear.create_issue(
        title="Write tests for PDF parser",
        description="Add unit tests and test fixtures",
        projectId=project.id,
        teamId="TEAM_ID"
    ),
    mcp_linear.create_issue(
        title="Update documentation",
        description="Add funcn.md and update component registry",
        projectId=project.id,
        teamId="TEAM_ID"
    )
]

# Get git branch names for each issue
branch_names = [mcp_linear.get_issue_git_branch_name(issueId=issue.id) for issue in issues]
# Returns: ['jayscambler/issue-123', 'jayscambler/issue-124', ...]
```

#### Why Use Projects with Multiple Issues

1. **Organized Work**: Projects group related issues together
2. **Progress Tracking**: See overall progress in project view
3. **Parallel Work**: Multiple developers can work on different issues
4. **Code Review**: Each issue gets its own PR for focused review
5. **Rollback Safety**: Can revert specific features without affecting others
6. **Flexible Organization**: Issues can be added to projects as work evolves

### 2. Create and Checkout Branch

After creating the Linear issue, create the corresponding branch:

```bash
# The branch name format from Linear: username/issue-number
git checkout -b jayscambler/issue-123

# Push the branch to set up tracking
git push -u origin jayscambler/issue-123
```

### 3. Make Changes with Sub-Issue Commits

Work through issues systematically, creating separate branches for each:

```bash
# Work on first issue
issue = issues[0]  # "Create PDF parser tool structure"

# Create and switch to issue branch
branch_name = mcp_linear.get_issue_git_branch_name(issueId=issue.id)
git checkout -b {branch_name}

# Update issue status
mcp_linear.update_issue(issueId=issue.id, stateId="in_progress")

# Make changes for this issue
# ... edit files ...

# Commit with issue reference
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Create PDF parser tool structure #ISSUE-123

- Set up component.json with metadata
- Create tool.py with basic structure
- Add __init__.py for exports"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin {branch_name}
gh pr create --title "ISSUE-123: Create PDF parser tool structure" \
  --body "Implements basic structure for PDF parser tool"

# Update issue to review status
mcp_linear.update_issue(issueId=issue.id, stateId="in_review")

# After PR is merged, move to next issue
git checkout main
git pull
# Repeat process for next issue
```

#### Best Practices for Issue-Based Development

1. **One Issue = One Branch/PR** for clean separation
2. **Reference Issue ID** in commit messages and PR titles
3. **Update Status** as you progress through the workflow
4. **Test After Each Sub-Issue** before moving to next
5. **Push Regularly** to save progress

### 4. Create Pull Request

When changes are ready:

```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed
git status

# Push latest changes
git push

# Create PR using GitHub CLI
gh pr create --title "Fix type hints in component manager" --body "Fixes #123

## Summary
- Updated deprecated type hints to modern syntax
- Fixed mypy warnings
- Added missing type annotations

## Test Plan
- [ ] Run mypy: `task lint`
- [ ] Run tests: `task test`
- [ ] Verify no regressions"
```

### 5. Handle Multiple Implementations with Git Worktrees

When exploring different approaches or working on multiple features simultaneously, use git worktrees:

```bash
# List current worktrees
git worktree list

# Add a new worktree for a different implementation
git worktree add ../funcn-feature-123 jayscambler/issue-123
git worktree add ../funcn-feature-124 jayscambler/issue-124

# Navigate between worktrees
cd ../funcn-feature-123  # Work on issue 123
cd ../funcn-feature-124  # Work on issue 124
cd ../funcn              # Main worktree

# Remove a worktree when done
git worktree remove ../funcn-feature-123
```

Benefits of worktrees:

- Work on multiple features without stashing/switching
- Compare different implementations side-by-side
- Keep dependencies isolated between features
- Faster context switching

## Best Practices

### Branch Naming

- Always use Linear-generated branch names: `username/issue-number`
- This maintains traceability between issues and code

### Commit Messages

- Reference the Linear issue: "Fix type hints #123"
- Use conventional commits when applicable:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `test:` for test additions/changes

### Before Creating PR

1. Ensure all tests pass: `task test`
2. Run linting: `task lint`
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Rebase on latest main if needed:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

### Worktree Guidelines

- Name worktrees descriptively: `funcn-feature-description`
- Keep worktrees in a parallel directory to main repo
- Clean up worktrees after PR is merged
- Don't create worktrees inside the main repository

## Emergency Procedures

### Reverting Changes

If you need to quickly revert changes:

```bash
# On feature branch - reset to previous commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# On main branch (if accidentally committed)
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Switching Context

If you need to quickly switch to another task:

```bash
# Option 1: Stash current changes
git stash push -m "WIP: feature description"
git checkout other-branch
# Later: git stash pop

# Option 2: Use worktrees (preferred)
git worktree add ../funcn-urgent-fix main
cd ../funcn-urgent-fix
# Make urgent fix
```

## Integration with Claude Code

When working with Claude Code:

1. Always start by asking to create a Linear issue
2. Remind Claude to checkout the feature branch
3. Use worktrees when comparing implementations
4. Ask Claude to create PR when changes are complete

### Example Claude Code Workflow with Projects

```python
# 1. Check for existing project or create new one
projects = mcp_linear.list_projects(teamId="TEAM_ID", includeArchived=False)
project = next((p for p in projects if "PDF" in p.name and not p.completedAt), None)

if not project:
    project = mcp_linear.create_project(
        name="PDF Parsing Tool",
        description="Create a new tool component for parsing PDF files",
        teamId="TEAM_ID"
    )

# 2. Create focused issues within the project
tasks = [
    {"title": "Set up component structure", "desc": "Create component.json and basic files"},
    {"title": "Implement PDF parsing", "desc": "Core PDF text extraction logic"},
    {"title": "Add error handling", "desc": "Handle edge cases and invalid PDFs"},
    {"title": "Write tests", "desc": "Unit tests with test fixtures"},
    {"title": "Documentation", "desc": "Create funcn.md and examples"}
]

issues = []
for task in tasks:
    issue = mcp_linear.create_issue(
        title=task["title"],
        description=task["desc"],
        projectId=project.id,
        teamId="TEAM_ID"
    )
    issues.append(issue)

# 3. Work through issues with separate branches
for i, issue in enumerate(issues):
    # Get branch name and checkout
    branch_name = mcp_linear.get_issue_git_branch_name(issueId=issue.id)
    # git checkout -b jayscambler/fun-123
    
    # Update status
    mcp_linear.update_issue(issueId=issue.id, stateId="in_progress")
    
    # Make focused changes for this issue
    # ... implement specific feature ...
    
    # Commit with issue reference
    # git commit -m "feat: {issue.title} #{issue.identifier}"
    
    # Create PR for this issue
    # gh pr create --title "{issue.identifier}: {issue.title}"
    
    # After merge, mark complete
    mcp_linear.update_issue(issueId=issue.id, stateId="completed")
    
    # Add progress comment on project
    mcp_linear.update_project(
        id=project.id,
        description=project.description + f"\n- ✅ Completed: {issue.title}"
    )
```

#### Parallel TODOs and Linear Issues

Use both systems together:

- **Linear Issues**: For PRs and external tracking
- **Claude TODOs**: For fine-grained task management during coding

```python
# Linear issue: "Implement PDF parsing"
# Claude TODOs for this issue:
todos = [
    "Research PDF parsing libraries",
    "Install and configure PyPDF2",
    "Create basic text extraction function",
    "Handle multi-page documents",
    "Test with sample PDFs"
]
```

Example interaction:
```
User: "I need to add a new PDF parsing tool"
Claude: "I'll help you add a PDF parsing tool. Let me first create a Linear issue for this work, then checkout the appropriate branch before making changes."
```
