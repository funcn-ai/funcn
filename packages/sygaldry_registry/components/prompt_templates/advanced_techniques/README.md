# Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

These advanced techniques represent sophisticated strategies for complex reasoning, verification, and problem-solving. Each technique is based on research in prompt engineering and demonstrates how to achieve more reliable and nuanced outputs from LLMs.

## Techniques Overview

### 1. Tree of Thought (ToT) - `tree_of_thought.py`

Explores multiple solution paths in parallel, evaluating and pruning branches to find optimal solutions.

**Theory**: Based on the paper "Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models", this technique mimics human problem-solving by considering multiple approaches simultaneously.

**When to use:**

- Complex problem-solving requiring exploration
- Tasks with multiple valid approaches
- Problems where backtracking might be necessary
- Strategic planning and decision-making

**Key features:**

- Parallel path exploration
- Dynamic evaluation and pruning
- Beam search optimization
- Backtracking capabilities

**Example applications:**

- Mathematical proofs
- Game strategy (chess, puzzles)
- Route planning
- Algorithm design

### 2. Self-Consistency - `self_consistency.py`

Generates multiple independent solutions and finds consensus for improved reliability.

**Theory**: Leverages the "wisdom of crowds" principle by sampling multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer.

**When to use:**

- High-stakes decisions requiring reliability
- Tasks where single outputs might be unreliable
- Problems with clear correct/incorrect answers
- Reducing hallucination risk

**Key features:**

- Multiple independent reasoning paths
- Statistical consensus finding
- Confidence scoring
- Ensemble-based approach

**Example applications:**

- Medical diagnosis
- Financial analysis
- Fact verification
- Critical decision support

### 3. Chain of Verification (CoVe) - `chain_of_verification.py`

Systematically verifies answers by generating and answering verification questions.

**Theory**: Implements a self-checking mechanism where the model creates questions to verify its own outputs, similar to human fact-checking.

**When to use:**

- Accuracy-critical tasks
- Fact-heavy content generation
- Claims requiring verification
- Reducing factual errors

**Key features:**

- Automatic verification question generation
- Systematic fact-checking
- Multi-round verification
- Confidence tracking

**Example applications:**

- Research summaries
- Technical documentation
- News article fact-checking
- Educational content

### 4. Rephrase and Respond - `rephrase_and_respond.py`

Improves understanding by rephrasing queries before responding.

**Theory**: Based on the observation that rephrasing can help models better understand intent and nuance, reducing ambiguity.

**When to use:**

- Ambiguous or unclear queries
- Multi-intent questions
- Complex technical questions
- International/cultural contexts

**Key features:**

- Query clarification
- Intent extraction
- Multiple interpretation handling
- Context enhancement

**Example applications:**

- Customer support systems
- Search query processing
- Technical Q&A
- Cross-language understanding

### 5. Meta-Prompting - `meta_prompting.py`

Uses the model to generate and optimize its own prompts.

**Theory**: Leverages the model's understanding of effective prompting to create better prompts for specific tasks.

**When to use:**

- Prompt optimization tasks
- Automated prompt engineering
- Domain-specific prompt creation
- Adaptive systems

**Key features:**

- Self-improving prompts
- Task-specific optimization
- Performance evaluation
- Iterative refinement

**Example applications:**

- Automated prompt libraries
- Domain adaptation
- Performance optimization
- Custom task creation

## Implementation Patterns

### Async Pattern for Parallel Processing

```python
import asyncio
from mirascope import llm, prompt_template

async def parallel_reasoning(problem: str):
    # Generate multiple solutions concurrently
    tasks = [
        generate_solution(problem, approach=i) 
        for i in range(5)
    ]
    solutions = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return find_consensus(solutions)
```

### Verification Loop Pattern

```python
def verify_until_confident(content: str, threshold: float = 0.9):
    confidence = 0.0
    rounds = 0
    
    while confidence < threshold and rounds < 3:
        verification = verify_content(content)
        content = verification.revised_content
        confidence = verification.confidence
        rounds += 1
    
    return content, confidence
```

### Tree Exploration Pattern

```python
def explore_with_pruning(problem: str, beam_width: int = 3):
    beam = initialize_beam(problem)
    
    for depth in range(max_depth):
        # Expand all paths
        new_paths = expand_paths(beam)
        
        # Evaluate and prune
        scored_paths = evaluate_paths(new_paths)
        beam = select_top_k(scored_paths, k=beam_width)
        
    return best_path(beam)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Computational Cost**: Advanced techniques use more tokens and API calls - use judiciously
2. **Combine Techniques**: Many techniques work well together (e.g., CoVe + Self-Consistency)
3. **Set Thresholds**: Define clear stopping criteria (confidence levels, max iterations)
4. **Monitor Performance**: Track metrics like accuracy improvement vs. cost
5. **Fallback Strategies**: Have simpler approaches ready if advanced techniques fail

## Performance Considerations

| Technique | Token Usage | Latency | Accuracy Gain | Best Model Size |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Tree of Thought | Very High | High | High | Large (GPT-4+) |
| Self-Consistency | High | Medium | Medium-High | Medium+ |
| Chain of Verification | High | Medium | High | Medium+ |
| Rephrase & Respond | Medium | Low | Medium | Small+ |
| Meta-Prompting | Medium | Low | Variable | Medium+ |

## Debugging Tips

1. **Log Intermediate Steps**: Use Lilypad tracing to see all reasoning paths
2. **Visualize Trees**: For ToT, create visual representations of exploration
3. **Compare Baselines**: Always compare against simpler techniques
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Advanced techniques may behave unexpectedly on simple tasks
5. **Monitor Convergence**: Track if techniques are actually improving outputs
