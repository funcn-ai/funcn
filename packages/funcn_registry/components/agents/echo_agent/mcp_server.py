"""MCP server entrypoint for the ``echo_agent``.

This module exists to keep the main ``echo_agent.py`` focused on the agent
implementation itself. It provides a ``run_mcp_server`` helper that can be
used to launch the agent as either a stdio or HTTP/SSE server, following the
Mirascope MCP guidelines.

    The helper blocks until the server is stopped (i.e., until the stdio
    connection is closed or the HTTP server is shut down).
